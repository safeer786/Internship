Focal points and iterated best response
to understand iterated best response with focal point consider the following exampl:
lets suppose we have a game of hide and seek 4 doors one is the winning door and rest three are looser so seeker wins if the hider looses so we 
have a probability of 25% of a door being selected at random by hider and by seeker.
Now if we take a look at the image again we see that the doors linear arangment and the labeling have an effect of the human reasoning which is called NON-NUTRAL PSYCOLOGICAL EFFECT by behavioural game theorist.
And when Rubinstien in 1996 put this to test the results were quite different as shown below.
These results can be explained by Iterated Best Response(IBR).
IBR have two assumptions:
1) There are focal points in the presentation of game that attract the attention of the reasoners before they engage in the further streagic delibration.
2) They compute best response to focal point behaviour (if they can) to which they compute best respone and so on.
So coming back to our example the hider might anticipate that this door is unique lets put in this but he would anticipate that hider might think the same so he does not mark this and chooses an other door but then he thinks that hider might think the samething so he should choose the same door. This will eventually end by in a reasoning loop.
Semantic meaning as a focal point:
Schelling point in co-ordination: the idea of focal point that attract our intension and thus effect psycological reasoning in very natural.
Schelling idea was that independent coordinates choices will have a scilent option. For example if two persons have to mark a meeting place in NewYork where they can not discuuss the meeting place beforehand but know that it is commonly known to both sides that they are facing the same problem.
then it is not fairly natural to assume butemprically supported that they will coordinate on choices which are psycologically scilent which in this case would be Grand Central Terminal in Manhatten.
what counts as psycologically scilent under which cercumstance is seperate interesting and empirial question.
Focality of Strating point of delibration:
The role of focal points in an ibr model is different.
focal points in the ibr model are the reasoning about starting point. Focal point reasoning in ibr is also not
confined to coordination games, as the above ‘hide-and-seek’ game illustrates:
reasoners might convince themselves that playing a focal strategy is not a good
idea. In other words, reasoners may reason themselves away from focality,
rather than being attracted by it through or after deliberation. 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Semantic Meaning as Focal. Focal point reasoning 
is fairly intuitive also for models of natural language interpretation.
The model of pragmatic reasoning  rests
on the following Focal Meaning Assumption: the semantic meaning
of messages is a focal point, much like the door labeled B in
the above ‘hide-and-seek’ game: even though strategically semantic meaning
is not binding, it is fairly intuitive to start pondering how to use an expression
and what might have been meant by its use by assessing first the expression’s
semantic meaning.
Thus conceived, the Focal Meaning Assumption is a solution to a technical
problem —the problem how to implement semantic meaning non-bindingly
in the solution concept for games— which has a general, independent empirical
motivation in the psychology of reasoners. On top of that, I believe that the
Focal Meaning Assumption is not entirely implausible for the intended purpose
either: it is not unnatural to assume that the conventional meaning of an
expression provides the best first clue to utterance meaning. Using rationalistic
vocabulary we could say that, given a semantically meaningful message,
the hearer would like to rationalize why the speaker said what he said. So,
as a starting point of his deliberation the hearer asks himself, what he would
do if the message was indeed true. But then he might realize that the sender
could anticipate this response. In that case, the hearer is best advised to take
the sender’s strategic incentives —her preferences and action alternatives—
into consideration. Similarly, a na¨ıve sender might just say whatever is true
at a given occasion. But with some more pragmatic sophistication she might
reason her way up the ibr ladder where she includes her expectations of the
receiver’s responses to her na¨ıve sending strategy. The resulting hypothetical
reasoning on both the sender and the hearer side can be modelled as
a sequence of iterated best responses that, crucially, takes its origin in a focal
point constituted by semantic meaning. And this is, in bare outline, the
solution concept that this chapter will put forward.

2.1.2 Iterated Best Response Reasoning as Pragmatic Inference
ibr models not only help implement possible psychological reasoning biases
in the form of focal starting points of the deliberation, but they also intend to
capture (some of) the natural resource-bounded limitations of actual human
reasoning. . What is generally
at stake can be appreciated also intuitively based on so-called ‘p-beauty
contest’ games, which I will tend to presently. A subsequent look at subjects’
reasoning in particular dynamic games will help refine the general picture.
‘p-Beauty Contest’ Games.  In such a
‘p-beauty contest’ each player from a group of size n > 2 chooses a number
from zero to 100. The player closest to p times the average wins. When this
game is played with parameter p = 2/3 by a group of subjects who have never
played the game before, the usual group average lies somewhere between 20
and 30, which is curiously far from the group average zero which we would
expect from common (true) belief in rationality and which is the only Nash
equilibrium in this game.
The reasoning with which a player may arrive at the conclusion that zero
is the analytically best choice in a ‘p-beauty contest’ with p = 2/3 is the following:
a rational player will not play a number bigger than 67 because any
such number has a lower chance of winning than exactly 67;6 but if a rational
player believes that her opponents are rational and will therefore realize
this much, she should not play any number higher than 2/3 × 66 = 44 by
the same reasoning; again, a rational player who is convinced that her opponents
are rational and believe in the rationality of others will play maximally
2/3 × 44  29, and so on. Further iterated steps of such reasoning will lead to
the conclusion that zero is the best choice, in fact the only choice compatible
with common belief in rationality.
Nonetheless, but perhaps unsurprisingly, few subjects in experimental
plays of this game choose zero — be that the first time they play this game or
in later rounds after having observed the behavior of other players. Rather, a
large pool of data on these kinds of games suggests that “the typical subject
uses only one or two steps of reasoning (starting from 50)” (Camerer 2003,
p. 218).
A non-zero choice is by no means a bad choice, of course. If (you believe
that) everybody else chooses relatively high numbers, you do not want
to choose too low a number yourself. What a number choice in this game
actually represents is a player’s estimate of the estimate (of the estimate . . . )
of other players: provided a player is rational, her choice will be around 2/3
her estimated average; but that means that any choice of number other than
zero is either irrational —which we will exclude— or indicative of a belief
that some or most other players are a little less smart than the choosing player
herself. What any choice other than zero therefore truly expresses is a belief
in the relative reasoning incapabilities of others and a certain amount of overconfidence:
bluntly put, a non-zero choice says “I think I am smarter than
you guys are (on average).”
In sum, ‘p-beauty contest’ games show, both experimentally and intuitively,
a general healthy tendency of human subjects to distrust other players’
ideal and flawless rational behavior and/or reasoning capabilities. Similar results
have been obtained from experiments on different kinds of games. Stahl
and Wilson (1995), for instance, tested subjects’ performance on static games
some of which had unique solutions in either one or two steps of iterated
strict dominance. Camerer (2003) discusses a wealth of experiments on similarly
‘dominance-solvable’ games, amongst others variants of the centipede
game, variants of the muddy children puzzle and the ‘electronic mail’ game
(Rubinstein 1989). Despite the heterogeneity of the tested games, a rough and
general conclusion —to be scrutinized presently— seems feasible: subjects’
performance in experimental conditions drops to the extent that the tested
choice requires higher levels of iterated reasoning. The more careful question
we should ask though is: what exactly is the limitation in subjects’ game
theoretic reasoning due to?

Iterated Dominance in Dynamic Games. A dynamic two-player game like
that in figure 2.1 may help shed light on this issue. In this game, first player
player 1 continued to play initially, and finally player 1 gets another choice
to continue or quit if player 2 decided to continue too. Clearly, if ever player
1’s last choice point is reached she should choose to continue because that
will give her a payoff of 4 as opposed to 2. Then, if player 2 realizes that
player 1 will play c at her last choice point, player 2 should quit when she
gets the chance, securing a payoff of 4 instead of 3. But then, anticipating
player 2’s behavior, player 1 should already initially quit the game to obtain 3
utils instead of only 1 util.
This kind of backward induction reasoning on player 1’s part corresponds
with her ascribing to player 2 both rationality and the belief that player
1 will make a rational choice at her last choice point (Aumann 1995; Stalnaker
1998). In other words, player 1 will play the prediction of backward induction,
if she believes that (i) player 2 is rational and that (ii) player 2 believes
that player 1 herself is rational (assuming, that is, that the game structure is
common knowledge).
This suggests that player 1’s initial choice, whether to continue or quit,
is diagnostic of the depth of strategic reasoning that player 1 is capable of,
including the depth of strategic reasoning that player 1 is able to ascribe to
player 2. Hedden and Zhang (2002) indeed argue that player 1’s initial choice
is indicative in particular of whether player 1 is using first- or second-order
Theory of Mind reasoning (tom reasoning) (Premack and Woodruff 1978):
according to common classification, zeroth-order tom reasoning is reasoning
that takes into account one’s own desires and beliefs about the state of
the world only, first-order tom reasoning takes into account others’ desires
and (zeroth-order) beliefs, and (n + 1)-th-order tom reasoning takes into account
others’ desires and n-th-order beliefs. According to Hedden and Zhang,
player 1’s initial choice to continue is indicative of her using first-order theory
of mind:7 if player 1 does not reason about player 2’s first-order theory, she
must think that player 2 is a zeroth-level reasoner who does not take player
1’s incentives into account, and therefore, Hedden and Zhang assume, a firstorder
player 1 will assume that player 2 will choose to continue, hoping for an
average payoff of 41/2 . On the other hand, if player 1 uses second-order tom
reasoning she will choose to quit initially, as predicted by backward induction
and its above epistemic justification.
Hedden and Zhang conclude based on their experimental data that most
subjects initially only apply first-order tom reasoning, and only later possibly
advance to second-order tom reasoning when playing against a first-order
confederate player 2. It is not essential to discuss the soundness of this conclusion
in minute detail. It suffices to note that the conclusion as such is in line
with the bulk of research on dominance-solvable games: subjects are capable
of one or two levels of iterated reasoning. Hedden and Zhang then suggest
that this may be due to a lack of tom reasoning capability. For clarity, this is a
thesis opposed to the idea that subjects, for instance, lack trust in rationality.
To say, as Hedden and Zhang do, that subjects lack the conceptual grasp or
the computational resources necessary for higher-order tom reasoning is different
from saying that belief in (belief in. . . ) rationality is waning proportional
to the depth of nesting of belief in rationality. Which position is correct, or
whether even both are or neither is, is a matter for more refined empirical
research that this thesis does not contribute to, unfortunately. Although the
model I will present in this chapter is, as far as I can see, compatible with both
explanations of human reasoning limitations in dominance solvable games, I
will adopt Hedden and Zhang’s idea that it is general tom reasoning that is
difficult —either to grasp or perform— and not so much faith in rationality
that is lacking.8
