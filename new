Focal points and iterated best response
to understand iterated best response with focal point consider the following exampl:
lets suppose we have a game of hide and seek 4 doors one is the winning door and rest three are looser so seeker wins if the hider looses so we 
have a probability of 25% of a door being selected at random by hider and by seeker.
Now if we take a look at the image again we see that the doors linear arangment and the labeling have an effect of the human reasoning which is called NON-NUTRAL PSYCOLOGICAL EFFECT by behavioural game theorist.
And when Rubinstien in 1996 put this to test the results were quite different as shown below.
These results can be explained by Iterated Best Response(IBR).
IBR have two assumptions:
1) There are focal points in the presentation of game that attract the attention of the reasoners before they engage in the further streagic delibration.
2) They compute best response to focal point behaviour (if they can) to which they compute best respone and so on.
So coming back to our example the hider might anticipate that this door is unique lets put in this but he would anticipate that hider might think the same so he does not mark this and chooses an other door but then he thinks that hider might think the samething so he should choose the same door. This will eventually end by in a reasoning loop.
Semantic meaning as a focal point:
