Focal points and iterated best response
to understand iterated best response with focal point consider the following exampl:
lets suppose we have a game of hide and seek 4 doors one is the winning door and rest three are looser so seeker wins if the hider looses so we 
have a probability of 25% of a door being selected at random by hider and by seeker.
Now if we take a look at the image again we see that the doors linear arangment and the labeling have an effect of the human reasoning which is called NON-NUTRAL PSYCOLOGICAL EFFECT by behavioural game theorist.
And when Rubinstien in 1996 put this to test the results were quite different as shown below.
These results can be explained by Iterated Best Response(IBR).
IBR have two assumptions:
1) There are focal points in the presentation of game that attract the attention of the reasoners before they engage in the further streagic delibration.
2) They compute best response to focal point behaviour (if they can) to which they compute best respone and so on.
So coming back to our example the hider might anticipate that this door is unique lets put in this but he would anticipate that hider might think the same so he does not mark this and chooses an other door but then he thinks that hider might think the samething so he should choose the same door. This will eventually end by in a reasoning loop.
Semantic meaning as a focal point:
Schelling point in co-ordination: the idea of focal point that attract our intension and thus effect psycological reasoning in very natural.
Schelling idea was that independent coordinates choices will have a scilent option. For example if two persons have to mark a meeting place in NewYork where they can not discuuss the meeting place beforehand but know that it is commonly known to both sides that they are facing the same problem.
then it is not fairly natural to assume butemprically supported that they will coordinate on choices which are psycologically scilent which in this case would be Grand Central Terminal in Manhatten.
what counts as psycologically scilent under which cercumstance is seperate interesting and empirial question.
Focality of Strating point of delibration:
The role of focal points in an ibr model is different.
focal points in the ibr model are the reasoning about starting point. Focal point reasoning in ibr is also not
confined to coordination games, as the above ‘hide-and-seek’ game illustrates:
reasoners might convince themselves that playing a focal strategy is not a good
idea. In other words, reasoners may reason themselves away from focality,
rather than being attracted by it through or after deliberation. 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Semantic Meaning as Focal. Focal point reasoning 
is fairly intuitive also for models of natural language interpretation.
The model of pragmatic reasoning  rests
on the following Focal Meaning Assumption: the semantic meaning
of messages is a focal point, much like the door labeled B in
the above ‘hide-and-seek’ game: even though strategically semantic meaning
is not binding, it is fairly intuitive to start pondering how to use an expression
and what might have been meant by its use by assessing first the expression’s
semantic meaning.
Thus conceived, the Focal Meaning Assumption is a solution to a technical
problem —the problem how to implement semantic meaning non-bindingly
in the solution concept for games— which has a general, independent empirical
motivation in the psychology of reasoners. On top of that
Focal Meaning Assumption is not entirely implausible for the intended purpose
either: it is not unnatural to assume that the conventional meaning of an
expression provides the best first clue to utterance meaning. Using rationalistic
vocabulary we could say that, given a semantically meaningful message,
the hearer would like to rationalize why the speaker said what he said. So,
as a starting point of his deliberation the hearer asks himself, what he would
do if the message was indeed true. But then he might realize that the sender
could anticipate this response. In that case, the hearer is best advised to take
the sender’s strategic incentives —her preferences and action alternatives—
into consideration but a naive sender might just say whatever is true
at a given occasion. But with some more pragmatic sophistication she might
reason her way up the ibr ladder where she includes her expectations of the
receiver’s responses to her naive sending strategy. The resulting hypothetical
reasoning on both the sender and the hearer side can be modelled as
a sequence of iterated best responses that, crucially, takes its origin in a focal
point constituted by semantic meaning.

2.1.2 Iterated Best Response Reasoning as Pragmatic Inference
ibr models not only help implement possible psychological reasoning biases
in the form of focal starting points of the deliberation, but they also intend to
capture (some of) the natural resource-bounded limitations of actual human
reasoning for example in a game of beauty contest  each player from a group of size n > 2 chooses a number
from zero to 100. The player closest to p times the average wins. if this game is played with the people who have never played this game before with p=2/3 average lies somewhere between 20
and 30, which is quite far from the group average zero which we would
expect from common (true) belief in rationality and which is the only Nash
equilibrium in this game. Reason of yero being the best choise is that rational player would not take number greater than 67 (2/3 *100) and if he thinks about the other players might think the same so might take 2/3*66  and this keeps on happening until it is zero.
The choice of non-zero by a rational person would indicate overconfidence.
this shows a general healthy tendency of human subjects to distrust other players’
ideal and flawless rational behavior and/or reasoning capabilities. what exactly is the limitation in subjects’ game
theoretic reasoning due to?

Iterated Dominance in Dynamic Games. A dynamic two-player game like
that in figure 2.1 may help shed light on this issue. In this game, first player
player 1 continued to play initially, and finally player 1 gets another choice
to continue or quit if player 2 decided to continue too. Clearly, if ever player
1’s last choice point is reached she should choose to continue because that
will give her a payoff of 4 as opposed to 2. Then, if player 2 realizes that
player 1 will play c at her last choice point, player 2 should quit when she
gets the chance, securing a payoff of 4 instead of 3. But then, anticipating
player 2’s behavior, player 1 should already initially quit the game to obtain 3
utils instead of only 1 util.
This kind of backward induction reasoning on player 1’s part corresponds
with her ascribing to player 2 both rationality and the belief that player
1 will make a rational choice at her last choice point.

                                    2.1.3 Strategic-Type Models
In order to capture the idea that human reasoning is at the same time bounded
in the number of analytical steps and overconfident in assuming that others
can be outperformed, several behavioral game theorists have postulated models featuring different strategic types of players . Detailed differences in
models notwithstanding, a strategic type captures the level of sophistication
of a player acorresponds to the number of steps that the agent is able to
 compute in a sequence of iterated best responses. This
number of steps is bounded above by the maximal order of tom reasoning
that the agent is capable of. It is then the set of all such strategic types, with
their beliefs and behavior, that forms the prediction of a strategic-type model.
Such strategic-type models are good predictors of experimental data, because
they are often simpler than competing theories (involving fewer parameters),
and more generally applicable at equal econometric fit  Additionally, these
models are also conceptually appealing for several reasons. First of all, these
models allow the implementation of focal points in a natural manner as starting
points of strategic reasoning. Moreover, strategic type models take seriously
the natural resource boundedness of tom reasoning, as demonstrated
in the last section. The advantage of this is that a strategic type model, as
an analytic solution concept, also yields predictions about boundedly rational
behavior that possibly falls short of the classical game theoretic ideals of
equilibrium or (play consistent with) common belief in rationality.
In the following section I will propose a model of strategic types of senders
and receivers in signaling games. The assumption that semantic meaning is
focal cashes out in the stipulation of level-zero players that do not engage
in strategic reasoning at all: they are blind to their opponent’s strategy and
preferences, and only take into account the semantic meaning of messages.
In particular, a level-zero sender would like to send arbitrarily any message
that is true; similarly a level-zero receiver would simply believe all messages
literally. Given a specification of level-zero players, we can define the behavior
of level-(k + 1) players by induction. A level-(k + 1) player believes that his
opponent is a level-k player and will play a best response to this belief.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
2.2 The Vanilla Model
Recall from the previous chapter that a signaling game (with meaningful signals)
is a tuple
h{S, R} , T, Pr,M, [[·]] , A,US,URi
where sender S and receiver R are the players of the game; T is a set of
states; Pr 2 D(T) is a probability distribution over T with full support; M
is a set of messages that the sender can send; [[·]] : M ! P(T) gives the
semantic meaning of a message; A is the set of receiver actions; and US,R :
T × M× A ! R are utility functions for both sender and receiver.
Generally speaking, the ibr model proposed here defines strategic types
of players in terms of their beliefs about the opponent’s behavior. More concretely,
a level-(k + 1) player believes that she is playing against a rational
level-k opponent. That is to say that I will assume here that each higher level
player believes that she is exactly one level more sophisticated than her opponent.
 Additionally to that we may allow level-(k + 1) players to have further
prejudices and beliefs about the belief formation and behavior of their opponents.
For ease of exposition though, I will first spell out a vanilla version of
the ibr model without such extra assumptions.
2.2.1 Strategic Types and the IBR Sequence
if we denote (i) a sender of strategic level k as an
abstract entity defined by the ibr model, but also (ii) the set of pure strategies
representing the unbiased belief of Rk+1 in his opponent’s behavior.
and have a Level-Zero Players and plays an arbitrary truthful
sender strategy and R0 plays an arbitrary strategy that is rational
given a literal which results from updating the prior beliefs with the semantic meaning of the observed message.
we can calculate the probability by Bayesian update:
d(Y|Z) = d(Y \ Z)/d(Z)
so a
level-zero receiver considers the semantic meaning of an observed message,
but does not take his opponent’s strategy into account.
Unbiased Beliefs. In the vanilla version of the ibr model, player types of
level k + 1 are simply defined as best responding to unbiased beliefs that their
opponent is a level-k player, without any further restrictions on these beliefs

Higher Level Types.  Sk+1 has an unbiased belief that she is
facing Rk, so —with full use of loose typing— Rk simply is Sk+1’s belief of her
opponents behavior.
The vanilla ibr model consequently predicts that if m is a surprise message
given belief in Sk, then Rk+1 will respond to m with any action that is zero-order
rationalizable in the play.
Limit Prediction. The ibr model defines an infinite sequence of ever more
sophisticated players. It is important to stress that the ibr model is not an
equilibrium solution concept, and that the behavior of boundedly rational
types belongs to its predictions even though such behavior may fall short of
the idealized predictions under common belief in rationality.
Nonetheless, the ibr model also makes predictions about unbounded tom
reasoners.
